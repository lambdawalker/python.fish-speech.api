# Self-hosted Python API client

The `fishapi` package wraps every explicit application route in the supported
Fish Speech server's `tools/server/views.py`. Install `fish-speech-api` (or the
GitHub source before the first release) and use `from fishapi import FishAPI`.
It requires Python 3.10+. No Torch, CUDA, or model installation is required on
the client computer.

The official [Fish Audio SDK](https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-audio-python)
targets the hosted API. Its voice management uses `/model`, whereas this local
server uses `/v1/references`. This small wrapper follows the local server.

## Launch

In the [DGX Spark server fork](https://github.com/lambdawalker/dgxspark.fish-speech),
after setup and downloading checkpoints (these launchers are not in this client repo):

```bash
./start-api.sh
# Or, for the Gradio interface:
./start-webui.sh
```

Both scripts enable compilation and reuse `$HOME/.cache/fish-speech/inductor`
(or `TORCHINDUCTOR_CACHE_DIR`). API: port 8080; WebUI: port 7860; both bind to
`0.0.0.0` for LAN access. WebUI public sharing is disabled. Extra arguments are
forwarded. Each running server loads its own model.

API authentication is optional: start with `--api-key YOUR_KEY` and pass the
same value as `api_key=` to the client. Without it, LAN clients can generate
speech and manage references. For loopback only, pass `--listen 127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Generate speech

```python
from fishapi import FishAPI

api = FishAPI('192.168.1.50')  # bare host/IP defaults to port 8080
# Also accepts '192.168.1.50:8081' or 'http://192.168.1.50:8080'.
print(api.health())

# Register once. Use a reference WAV and its actual transcript.
api.add_voice('speaker_a', 'speaker_a.wav', 'Words spoken in the reference.')
# addvoice(...) is an alias.
print(api.list_voices())

audio = api.generate(
    'I agree to deliver the furniture on Friday.',
    voice='speaker_a',
    output='turn_001.wav',
    seed=42,
    temperature=0.8,
)
```

`generate()` always returns audio bytes; `output` additionally saves them.
WAV is the default. Output directories must already exist. Existing output
files are overwritten on success. HTTP failure does not overwrite the output.
`voice` is an alias for the server's `reference_id` field. Other keyword options
are passed as TTS request fields, including `references`, `normalize`, `top_p`,
`repetition_penalty`, `max_new_tokens`, `chunk_length`, and `use_memory_cache`.
Inline references use base64-encoded audio strings and their transcripts.
Unknown fields may be ignored by the server; consult `ServeTTSRequest` in
`fish_speech/utils/schema.py`. Use WAV for offline datasets; other formats depend
on the server's encoder support. Cloud-only controls such as speed are not added.

## Endpoint coverage

| Method | HTTP endpoint | Return value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `health()` | GET `/v1/health` | Status dictionary |
| `health(method='POST')` | POST `/v1/health` | Status dictionary |
| `webui()` | GET `/ui` | HTML string (404 if UI not built) |
| `generate(text, ...)` | POST `/v1/tts` | Complete audio bytes |
| `generate_stream(text, ...)` | POST `/v1/tts` | Iterator of WAV stream bytes |
| `add_voice(id, audio_path, text)` | POST `/v1/references/add` | Result dictionary |
| `list_voices()` | GET `/v1/references/list` | List of IDs |
| `rename_voice(old_id, new_id)` | POST `/v1/references/update` | Result dictionary |
| `delete_voice(id)` | DELETE `/v1/references/delete` | Result dictionary |
| `encode(audio_files)` | POST `/v1/vqgan/encode` | Nested token arrays |
| `decode(tokens)` | POST `/v1/vqgan/decode` | List of raw float16 PCM buffers |

`rename_voice` only renames a reference; it does not replace its recording.
Adding an existing ID raises an error. Metadata calls request JSON explicitly.
Framework-generated OpenAPI documentation routes are not application operations.

## Streaming and codec operations

```python
from contextlib import closing

with closing(api.generate_stream('Hello!', voice='speaker_a')) as chunks:
    with open('stream.wav', 'wb') as out:
        for chunk in chunks:
            out.write(chunk)
```

Streaming supports WAV only. Chunks are parts of one stream, not independent
WAV files. The WAV stream header may not contain a finalized duration; use
non-streaming generation for dataset files. Closing the generator releases its
connection if the caller stops early.

Only codec methods need an extra dependency:

```bash
uv add 'fish-speech-api[codec]'
# Before the first release, install ormsgpack alongside the GitHub client.
```

```python
from pathlib import Path

tokens = api.encode([Path('reference.wav').read_bytes()])
raw_audio_buffers = api.decode(tokens)
```

Codec requests and responses use MessagePack. Decode returns raw float16 PCM,
**not WAV**, and does not return the sample rate. Obtain the rate from the
server's decoder configuration before converting to a playable file.

## Errors and dataset jobs

HTTP and connection errors raise `FishAPIError` (HTTP errors include status and
server response). Local file and serialization errors propagate normally.
Read-time errors after response headers can also propagate as standard Python
I/O exceptions. The timeout defaults to 600 seconds; override with
`FishAPI(host, timeout=1200)` if the first compilation needs longer.
There are no automatic retries: retrying a generation may create duplicate work.

Use one request at a time initially. Store the turn text, speaker ID, seed,
settings and returned audio in your dataset pipeline. This client does not
provide a job queue, alignment, conversation generation, or resume tracking.

## Client validation

```bash
uv sync --locked
uv run --locked python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Tests use a local HTTP fixture to check request bodies, multipart uploads,
MessagePack, authentication, streaming, and output preservation on HTTP errors.
They do not load the speech model or validate GPU inference.
